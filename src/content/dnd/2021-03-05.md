### (Armor)

**[Breastplate of Elemental Absorption, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2131386-breastplate-of-elemental-absorption-1)**

> _Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. It has 6 charges, and regains 2d4 expended charges daily at dawn._
>
> _While attuned to this armor, whenever you are the target of - or subjected to a saving throw of - a spell or magical effect that would deal cold, fire, or lightning damage to you, you may use your reaction to cause the armor to absorb the spell on your behalf. If you do so, the spell has no effect on you, and the armor expends a number of charges equal to the spell's level. If the armor has fewer unspent charges than the level of the spell, it expends all remaining charges; then, roll 1d6+X where X is the difference between the absorbed spell's level and the number of charges that the armor spent. If the result is 5 or greater, the gem in the armor explodes, dealing 36 (12d6) force damage to you and all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each of these creatures other than you may make a DC 13 Dexterity save, taking half of that damage on a success. This explosion destroys both the armor and its enchantment._
>
> _Notes:_
>
> _- When absorbing a cantrip, the number of charges depends on the cantrip's scaling. As an example, consider firebolt: at its base level it deals 1d10 fire damage, which would require only one charge to absorb. Then, when the cantrip scales to 2d10 at level 5, it would require two charges to absorb; and so on._
>
> _- If you use the armor's ability to absorb an area of effect spell like fireball, it does not consume the entire spell. It absorbs the portion of the spell that would affect you directly, but any other creatures caught in the spell's area of effect would be unaffected by this armor's absorption and would interact with the spell as they otherwise would._

**[Armor of Attenuation, +1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2131395-armor-of-attenuation-1)**

> _Armor (half plate), very rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. It has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at dawn._
>
> _While attuned to this armor, when you are subjected to an effect that would deal acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage to you, you may use your reaction and expend one charge from the armor. If you do, you instead take only one third of that damage (rounded up). At the end of each of your next two turns, you take that same reduced amount of damage again._

**[Butcher's Bib](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/butchers-bib)**

> _Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _This black leather apron is perpetually covered by blood, even after being washed off. You gain the following benefits while wearing the apron:_
>
> _- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee attack with a weapon, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice. If you do so, you must use the second total._
>
> _- Your weapon attacks that deal slashing damage score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20._

> _Wondrous Item, rare_
>
> _As an action, you may turn the knob on this belt to one of three glyphs indicating cold, fire, or lightning. If you do, you have resistance to that element for 1 minute. Once you've used this feature, you cannot do so again until after you've finished a long rest._

### (Weaponry)

**[Staphuveight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2950466-staphuveight)**

> _Staff (quarterstaff), very rare (requires attunement)_
>
> _This transparent crystal staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it._
>
> _**Altered Outcome.** The staff has 6 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges to give yourself or one other creature that you can see a d4. The recipient can roll this d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn. If this extra die is not used before then, it is lost._
>
> _If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 9 or lower, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff that breaks the first time it scores a hit and deals damage. On a roll of 10 or higher, the staff regains 1d6 of its expended charges._
>
> _Proficiency with a quarterstaff allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it._

**[Tentacle Rod](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/tentacle-rod)**

> _Rod, rare (requires attunement)_

> _Made by the drow, this rod is a magic weapon that ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success._
