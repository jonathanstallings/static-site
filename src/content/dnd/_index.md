Currently, most of the game's historical record is not part of this collection; the early game's content is stuffed inside a redis database, and the middle game was not recorded, but lately - since our game alternates dates to work around different schedules - I've been making an effort to document each session so that absent players can stay caught up.

Maybe one day I'll drag the archival posts out of that db and create some backdated posts.
Maybe I'll also create some content for The Betweentimes.

Maybe.
