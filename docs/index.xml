 The Menagerie&amp;rsquo;s next goal was visible on the horizon: behind obsidian ramparts stood Arkhan&amp;rsquo;s tower, an obelisk capped with five large spikes, evidently defended by the great white dragon soaring lazily above it. Between the party and the tower stretched a cluttered expanse of slagged metal, jagged stone, and broken bones; likely the effects of a region claimed and hunted by dragons.</description>

 In the aftermath of the battle for Red Ruth&amp;rsquo;s home, the Menagerie reconvened in Gimble&amp;rsquo;s tiny hut to try for a long rest. After only a couple of hours, Red Ruth came back from her spa treatment looking centuries younger and perfectly willing to divulge to the party her knowledge of how to free Ralzala from her pact with Zariel.</description>

 This session was another session-long combat, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect!
The Menagerie took some time inspecting Red Ruth&amp;rsquo;s home and clearing, deciding how they should spend their time. Red Ruth had told them that she would return in several hours (probably a couple hours for the spa treatment, then however long it takes to travel between the Bone Brambles and the Wandering Emprium), and they pondered trying for a long rest.</description>

 Having gained a bag of devouring from the Bone Brambles, the Menagerie managed to find their way into the center of the maze-like thicket without running into further trouble. They found a sort of clearing - the canopy still closed the expanse from exterior light - in the middle of which rose a wattle-and-daub hut-like entrance to a path leading down into the earth.</description>

 The group had successfully escaped a combat with the narzugon Haruman, and retreated to the relative safety of the Field of Dreams in order to discuss their next course of action. Lulu investigated her fractured memories more closely, and concluded that while she couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall the actual location of Zariel&amp;rsquo;s ring, she remembered two different locations that each played a part in her previous traversals through Avernus to where the ring now lay.</description>

 This past session also featured a lot of combat, riding on the coattails of Horns&amp;rsquo; and Zed&amp;rsquo;s decision to free a soul from its impalement upon the steel branches of one of the Avernian iron trees that line the trail leading up the hill. A half dozen stirges descended upon the two while the rest of the party was moving further up the path.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been reading up about git-secret and realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really grasp what a PGP key is or how to use one (or more). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Keybase account since 2011, and it&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a disjointed mess. The addition and revocation of devices makes sense, since I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a couple of phones since 2011. However, my usage of PGP keys has been erratic.
You see, my nebulous grasp of PGP keys roughly equated them with SSH keys, and so I&amp;rsquo;d created and revoked a few of them.</description>

      <description>Porkbun is my new favorite domain registrar and had the best deals on .io domains that I could find, but I wanted to use DNSimple to manage my DNS settings. DNSimple offers a robust API and a Terraform provider, which is very appealing to my infrastructure-as-code aspirations. Luckily, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to get the best of both worlds:
  Through Porkbun, replace the domain&amp;rsquo;s default nameservers with DNSimple&amp;rsquo;s nameservers.</description>

      <description>43: Fomorian Forward Camp, Part 1 (2018-03-09)
The Menagerie stands at the mouth of a large tunnel, its entrance a static eruption of earth and stone. The slope is not gradual, but also not steep enough to hinder movement. The tunnel maintains a rough average of thirty feet in both width and height, and the earth is densely packed from the comings and goings of a small army. Haeltin&amp;rsquo;s heightened senses detect Anastrianna&amp;rsquo;s scent among that of many orogs leading into the cavern, so the party begins their descent; everyone is on foot except for Zed, who sits atop his elk mount, Bullwinkle.</description>

      <description>38: The Bookwyrm (2017-11-04)
Some time after parting ways with Goblin Hood and his Little John, Haeltin&amp;rsquo;s nose picks up a rather familiar scent, and his ears detect footfalls. Before long, the orc Bruce catches up with them (with the goblin still on his shoulders) with a plea for their aid. Goblin Hood tells them that a patrol from his clan found the two of them and took his book away in order to deliver it to The Parchment.</description>

      <description>37: Feywild 101 (2017-10-20)
The dusky lavender of twilight is still painted across the sky of the Feywild as the Menagerie stirs from their rest after falling into this new plane. Without warning, Haeltin disappears from the group; his companions are unable to trace his steps, and so they make their way to the edge of the forest.
As the trees give way to the long grasses of a hilly plain, they notice a small bit of smoke curling up from the end of a tiny cooking fire, attended to by an anthropomorphic fox.</description>

      <description>36: The Mission (2017-09-08)
(Finn, Gimble, Hael, Horns, Ivor, Val)
20-21 Uktar 1491 DR?
There is no sense of time within the portal, and after-images from everything the characters look at remain imprinted on their eyes. After seconds? minutes? they emerge from the portal, no longer on the Material Plane. They are greeted by the black, cloudless sky of Avernus, the first level of the Nine Hells of Baator, from which rain down burning comets and meteorites.</description>

20 Uktar 1491 DR
The party&amp;rsquo;s front line rushes towards the platform at the bottom of the stairs, while Horns and Reidoth remain on a bridge above, calling down lightning on the devils. The two spined devils take to the air, but the chain devil hooks one of them and drags it back to itself. After issuing a hurried command, the chain devil hurls the spined devil through the portal.</description>

The party presses further downward into the volcanic heart of Mt. Hotenow, harried by devils every step of the way. The human barbarian Ivor finally manages to catch up to the group, joining the fray by leaping from bridges above onto a spined devil. Hael continues his tradition of tossing enemies from heights, Horns continues his tradition of calling lightning, and Gimble webs a couple of flyers to the staircase.</description>

The battle into the heart of the caldera of Mt. Hotenow continues! The party continues to fight down heavy black iron steps and across swaying chain bridges. Finn climbs onto the back of Reidoth, who uses Wild Shape to turn into a giant owl, and together they engage in dogfighting with the spined devils that harass The Menagerie from the air.</description>

The Menagerie spends the night in the mouth of the lava tube that opens up onto the side of Mt. Hotenow. In the morning, they discover a small collection of shiny things that was the yeti&amp;rsquo;s hoard. Some of these things are useless junk, like broken vials or scraps of bent metal. Others are items like gold coins, a few mundane weapons, and a +1 Wand of the War Caster.</description>

(Finn, Gimble, Hael, Horns, Val)
The party takes a couple of days in Neverwinter to obtain supplies and take care of some things before they make their journey into the Nine Hells of Baator:
  Sildar needs the name of an individual or collective in order to sign over the deed to Tresendar Manor and its grounds, and the party settles upon the moniker of &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;The Menagerie.</description>

      <description>30: Thundertree: The Devil You Know, and Were Is Grey (2017-04-14)
(Finn, Gimble, Grey, Horns, Zane)
 Reidoth has something very important to tell the party  30 years ago, the activity in Mt. Hotenow was the result of a host of devils from the Nine Hells coming through a portal from Avernus. The Emerald Enclave was able to drive back the host, but not without suffering great losses themselves. With help from those who remained of the Enclave, Reidoth was able to bind the commander of the host into a magical prison and sink it in the waters off of the Sword Coast.</description>

      <description>import campaign,&amp;quot;&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;The sky is grey and tinged with regret.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
 import campaign is a Seattle-based fifth-edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign run by a Python developer for several other Python developers (&amp;hellip;plus a couple folks who aren&amp;rsquo;t). The campaign started out taking the players through the Lost Mines of Phandelver module, and is now going off the rails into custom content.
We meet every other Friday, and sometimes we&amp;rsquo;ll tweet about it with #importcampaign.</description>
