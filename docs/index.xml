 The Menagerie&amp;rsquo;s next goal was visible on the horizon: behind obsidian ramparts stood Arkhan&amp;rsquo;s tower, an obelisk capped with five large spikes, evidently defended by the great white dragon soaring lazily above it. Between the party and the tower stretched a cluttered expanse of slagged metal, jagged stone, and broken bones; likely the effects of a region claimed and hunted by dragons.</description>

 In the aftermath of the battle for Red Ruth&amp;rsquo;s home, the Menagerie reconvened in Gimble&amp;rsquo;s tiny hut to try for a long rest. After only a couple of hours, Red Ruth came back from her spa treatment looking centuries younger and perfectly willing to divulge to the party her knowledge of how to free Ralzala from her pact with Zariel.</description>

 This session was another session-long combat, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect!
The Menagerie took some time inspecting Red Ruth&amp;rsquo;s home and clearing, deciding how they should spend their time. Red Ruth had told them that she would return in several hours (probably a couple hours for the spa treatment, then however long it takes to travel between the Bone Brambles and the Wandering Emprium), and they pondered trying for a long rest.</description>

 Having gained a bag of devouring from the Bone Brambles, the Menagerie managed to find their way into the center of the maze-like thicket without running into further trouble. They found a sort of clearing - the canopy still closed the expanse from exterior light - in the middle of which rose a wattle-and-daub hut-like entrance to a path leading down into the earth.</description>

 The group had successfully escaped a combat with the narzugon Haruman, and retreated to the relative safety of the Field of Dreams in order to discuss their next course of action. Lulu investigated her fractured memories more closely, and concluded that while she couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall the actual location of Zariel&amp;rsquo;s ring, she remembered two different locations that each played a part in her previous traversals through Avernus to where the ring now lay.</description>

 This past session also featured a lot of combat, riding on the coattails of Horns&amp;rsquo; and Zed&amp;rsquo;s decision to free a soul from its impalement upon the steel branches of one of the Avernian iron trees that line the trail leading up the hill. A half dozen stirges descended upon the two while the rest of the party was moving further up the path.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been reading up about git-secret and realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really grasp what a PGP key is or how to use one (or more). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Keybase account since 2011, and it&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a disjointed mess. The addition and revocation of devices makes sense, since I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a couple of phones since 2011. However, my usage of PGP keys has been erratic.
You see, my nebulous grasp of PGP keys roughly equated them with SSH keys, and so I&amp;rsquo;d created and revoked a few of them.</description>

      <description>Porkbun is my new favorite domain registrar and had the best deals on .io domains that I could find, but I wanted to use DNSimple to manage my DNS settings. DNSimple offers a robust API and a Terraform provider, which is very appealing to my infrastructure-as-code aspirations. Luckily, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to get the best of both worlds:
  Through Porkbun, replace the domain&amp;rsquo;s default nameservers with DNSimple&amp;rsquo;s nameservers.</description>
